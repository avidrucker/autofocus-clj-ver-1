## FAQ

> What is "dotting" / "marking"?

When we dot / mark to a to-do item, we are saying that the item is "ready to do" or "prioritized". These items are said to be "dotted" or "marked". We add dots / marks to items when we review the list.

> What are the to-do item "statuses" ?

To-do items can be "clean", "marked", or "done". "Clean" refers to having no marks, and "done" refers to an item being completed. See above question for more info on "marked" items.
